# Sales Data Analysis Project (Excel | SQL | Power BI)

## About the Project
This project is based on a sales dataset where I worked on the complete data analysis process from start to end.  
The data was not clean initially, so I first focused on cleaning and preparing it properly before moving to analysis and visualization.

The main purpose of this project was to understand sales performance, identify top-performing categories and cities, and present the insights in a simple and clear way using a dashboard.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – for data cleaning and basic calculations  
- Power Query Editor – for transforming and standardizing the data  
- SQL – for analyzing the data using queries  
- Power BI – for creating an interactive dashboard  

---

## Dataset Information
- The original dataset contained missing values, inconsistent date formats, and text issues.
- After cleaning, the data became analysis-ready and was used for SQL analysis and Power BI visualization.

## What I Did in This Project

### 1. Data Cleaning (Excel + Power Query)
- Fixed inconsistent date formats  
- Handled missing and incorrect values  
- Cleaned city names, categories, and payment modes  
- Created a **Total Sales** column  
- Ensured correct data types for all columns  

This step helped make the data reliable and easy to analyze.

### 2. SQL Analysis
Using SQL, I analyzed the cleaned data to answer business-related questions such as:
- Total sales and total number of orders  
- Category-wise and city-wise sales performance  
- Average order value and quantity sold  

This helped me practice real-world SQL queries instead of just theoretical examples.

### 3. Power BI Dashboard
In Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard and added the following measures:
- Total Sales  
- Total Orders  
- Total Quantity Sold  
- Average Order Value (AOV)  

The dashboard provides a clear overview of sales performance across different categories and cities.

## Key Insights
- The Electronics category generated the highest revenue.  
- Delhi was the top-performing city in terms of sales.  
- The average order value was relatively high, indicating demand for premium products.

## What I Learned
- How to clean and prepare real-world messy data  
- How Excel, SQL, and Power BI work together in a data analysis workflow  
- How to extract meaningful insights from raw data  
- How to present data in a simple and understandable way

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how a Data Analyst works in real scenarios, from data cleaning to dashboard creation.  
It also strengthened my confidence in using Excel, SQL, and Power BI together.
